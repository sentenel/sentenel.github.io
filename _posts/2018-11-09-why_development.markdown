As a univeristy student, I studied pure mathematics. I was fascinated with how basic axioms and definitions could be developed into complex or surprising results. Logic, analysis, and creativity applied to the initial conditions allow new theorems to be proven, which in turn assist in further advancement. Each new theorem is another tool to use when approaching a problem, and every novel proof provides a new technique. When given a challenging problem, it was fun to experiment with those different tools and techniques, trying to find the one that would solve it.

At their core, challenges in programming are very similar to challenges in math. Instead of axioms, definitions, and theorems, there are coding languages, objects, and methods. Formulating hypotheses and proving theorems is replaced by deciding functionality and passing tests. Yet in both cases, approaching a problem is a matter of using the tools and techniques available and finding the right combination to solve it. In both cases, progress is cumulative, where completing a challenge can provide another available tool, and the work done on one problem may provide insight into how to approach another.

I've chosen to be a developer because it allows me to continue doing what I love: taking something simple and building something more.
